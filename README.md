# Custom Audio Player with WaveSurfer.js

A modern, visually appealing audio player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the WaveSurfer.js library for generating waveforms. This player comes with interactive playback controls, a dynamic waveform visualization, and a sleek design that includes album artwork with a gradient overlay for readability.

## Features

- **Waveform Visualization**: Displays a dynamic waveform that visualizes the audio track, powered by WaveSurfer.js.
- **Play, Pause, Rewind, and Fast-Forward Controls**: Easy to use playback controls to play, pause, skip forward or backward through the track.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume directly within the player using a slider.
- **Gradient Overlay on Album Art**: A smooth gradient is applied to the album artwork, ensuring that the bottom of the image is subtly faded for better text visibility.
- **Responsive Design**: The player is designed to work well across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the player and UI components.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the player, including gradient overlays, buttons, and waveform customization.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Used for controlling the playerâ€™s functionality and interaction with the WaveSurfer.js library.
- **WaveSurfer.js**: A powerful library for generating customizable waveforms for audio files.

## Setup

To use this player locally or in your project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-audio-player.git
cd custom-audio-player
```

### 2. Include WaveSurfer.js

Make sure you are loading WaveSurfer.js from a CDN in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/wavesurfer.js/4.6.0/wavesurfer.min.js"></script>
```

### 3. Structure of the Files

- `index.html`: Contains the markup structure for the player.
- `styles.css`: Contains the custom styles for the player, including the gradient overlay and control button designs.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for managing the playback controls, volume, and waveform visualization.

### 4. How to Run

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the audio player. 

### 5. Modify for Your Own Audio File

To use your own audio file, replace the audio file URL in the `script.js` file:

```javascript
// Load your audio file
wavesurfer.load('YOUR_AUDIO_FILE_URL.mp3');
```

Replace the URL with the location of your own `.mp3` file, and the player will automatically load your track.
